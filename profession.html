<h1><strong>My "Profession"</strong></h1>
<br><br>
<h2>This is What I Do</h2>
<br><br>

<p> So as I said on the home page, I am a 14 year old Freshman that attends Hoffman Estates High School. I also play for the Freshman B Soccer team here at Hoffman.<br>
    Here at Hoffman, I take 8 total classes but, they are split into 2 days. Here we have A days and B days. On A days, I have all my regular classes. 1st I have Spanish (2), then English, then Math,
    then Freshman Foundations. Then on B days I have Gym 1st, then Frosh Study Lab, 3rd AP Computer Science (best), and finally Biology. Below, you will find a 2 charts
    that show you the timing of my classes and a link to the website of my favorite soccer player and a link that will direct you to my school's website.</p>
